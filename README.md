# How to run the program
 The code is of a .c file and therefore can run on any C language compiler.

## Step 1 
 The program will ask the user whether they would like to run workloads on all algorithms or on one specific algorithm.
 Enter 1 - Run on all algorithms
 Enter 2 - Run on one specific algorithm
 Enter any other value - Will ask for input again until receives the value 1 or 2
 
## Step 2
 If the choice in step 1 is 1, then skip this step. If the choice is 2, the program will ask for the algorithm that the user wants to run their workloads on.
 Enter 1 - First Come First Serve
 Enter 2 - Shortest Job First Non Preemptive Version
 Enter 3 - Round Robin
 Enter any other value - will ask for input again until receives the value 1, 2 or 3
 
## Step 3
 The program will ask the user for the number of processes in each workload (there are 2 worloads in total). Enter the values separately based on the displayed question.
 
## Step 4
 Based on the number of processes given earlier, the program will ask for the burst time and arrival time of each process respectively. If the round robin algorithm is involved, the program would also ask for overhead time, whether to display an output with no overhead (if overhead given is more than 0) and the quantum time.

## Output
 After going through the above stes, the output will be displayed by the program.
